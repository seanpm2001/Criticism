## Why keep a criticism repository

The criticism repository was created for transparency and documentation purposes. It is used to archive criticism, address criticism, and link to criticism. It is believed that this will help me recover from criticism, and add transparency to the process. The amount of criticism present will likely not look good, but keep in mind that every little thing will be mentioned.
